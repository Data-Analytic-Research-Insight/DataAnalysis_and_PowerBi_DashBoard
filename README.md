# DataAnalysis_and_PowerBi_DashBoard || Data wrangling / Data Analysis:
- In this repo i have used:
  - Exploratory Data analysis (EDA): For understanding the data, i performed some EDA.
  - Data Wrangling: For organizing the differentes segments in each column, for further analysis i have to do some wrangling
  - Data Cleansing: For cleaning and excluding outliers (not needed in this case) i used some techniques as IQR(inter quartile range), so i could work on a more realiable data, also doing some distributions, for further understanding of the data i was dealing with at each moment of the process.
  - DashBoards: Creating an interactive Power Bi dashboard with the data generated as a final product.
- Tools Used:
  - Laguage: Python
  - Libs: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy
  - Dependencies managing: Poetry
  - Metrics and Dashboard: Power Bi

The Proyect was generated with the intention of showing some statistics about properties in Capital Federal, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The data was gathered by a scrapper that i developed (that helped me to move to an apartment below the average price for that time)
